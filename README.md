# EE319K-Honors

This repository contains the programming assignments I completed for Dr. Valvano's's EE 319K-Honors Introduction to Embedded Systems course at the University of Texas at Austin. I took this course during the Spring 2021 semester.

## Disclaimer
If you are taking the course right now, PLEASE don't copy my code. These programming assignments are great to learn the concepts of the class and very useful to try and implement on your own. There's no point in taking the class if you aren't going to take the time to learn the material and do the assignments. I put this repository on GitHub solely for the purpose of having a collection of my code/programming assignments and for resume purposes. It is never my intention to provide cheats for current students, and I suggest that you don't cheat your educational experience either.
